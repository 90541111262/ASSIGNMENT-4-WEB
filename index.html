<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I'm a Brazilian graphic designer and art director with a specialization in marketing,
    and I'm 38 years old. Graphic design is a great passion in my life, I do my work with
    many criteria and always seek to evolve within my creative processes with a reference
    search and constant updating.<br>
    In 23 years of experience working in this area, I developed actions focused on planning,
    creation, and execution of editorial design, branding, and advertising projects, where
    I could work on the front line in many of them.</p>
